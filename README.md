# Hello-World
Just a repository to pratice.
Dave here.  My favorite software project was leading the team that wrote all the code for the first Smartphone, Simon. All the major Smortphone companies recognize that we were the first (I know because I get subpoenaed and depositioned every time they have a major legal battle).
